# Smashing Magazine Design Teardown Project

This purpose of this project was to analyze visual hierarchy by graying out the content from [Smashing Magazine's homepage](https://www.smashingmagazine.com).
Additionally, I toyed around with different font properties and typefaces from Google Web Fonts.

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown).
